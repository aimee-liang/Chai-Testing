## Chai-Testing

### Summary
This repository will be focused on using both Mocha and Chai for unit testing.

### What are Mocha and Chai?
Mocha and Chai are two separate frameworks, most often paired together for JavaScript unit testing. They run on Node.js and in the browser. Mocha is BDD: Behavior Driven Development, while Chai is TDD: Test-Driven Development which allows you to use assertions.

### How to Run
Clone this repository to your local machine. In your terminal or local IDE, run the command `npm test`. You should be able to view whether the tests pass or fail in your terminal.
